# Cursor Rules — Template Guidance

Agent guidance

- Match existing code patterns and naming. Keep diffs small.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness. Ask before structural changes.
- Don’t add dependencies or files unless essential for the user's goal.

Defaults (prefer unless code shows otherwise)

- Next.js 14 App Router; Server Components by default. Add 'use client' only for state/effects/events
- pnpm + Node LTS; lockfile committed
- Imports: absolute from `src` for app code; relative inside a component folder
- Folder‑per‑component: `src/components/atoms/<Name>/<Name>.tsx`

Styling & layout

- Tailwind utilities; minimal global CSS;

TypeScript & DX

- Strict TS, explicit prop types, PascalCase filenames, named exports
- ESLint (Airbnb + Next + jsx-a11y) + Prettier; keep `pnpm lint/format` clean

Testing (optional)

- If enabled, start with one RTL smoke test for the home page

When in doubt

- Follow the patterns in the file you’re editing
- Use semantic HTML and keep a11y intact
- Keep things minimal—avoid scope creep
- If conflicting conventions appear, prefer consistency within the folder

Divergence

- Downstream projects can change structure/tools. Keep semantics/a11y and readability
